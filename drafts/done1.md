# Google is adding "Projects" feature to Gemini to run research tasks

**TL;DR**: Google's Gemini is now
testing
a new feature called "Projects." This will be similar to OpenAI's Project Feature for ChatGPT. In addition to Projects, Google is working on Gemini 3, which would be the company's most powerful model to date, and it could deliver a big blow to OpenAI. With Projects, you can add files, documents or your code. Then, you can ask Gemini to reference those files in project conversations. Google describes this as a feature where you "start by adding files to the project.

Google's Gemini is now [testing](https://x.com/testingcatalog/status/1956346444786327896) a new feature called "Projects." This will be similar to OpenAI's Project Feature for ChatGPT.

With Projects, you can add files, documents or your code. Then, you can ask Gemini to reference those files in project conversations.

Google describes this as a feature where you "start by adding files to the project. Gemini can reference these files in project conversations and use them to generate new documents and code."

With Projects, you can group similar tasks together and create your own workplace within Gemini.

It's unclear when the feature will begin rolling out, but it could be limited to enterprise customers initially.

In addition to Projects, Google is working on Gemini 3, which would be the company's most powerful model to date, and it could deliver a big blow to OpenAI.

Google rolls out Genie 3
------------------------

Google recently [announced](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/) Genie 3, which is developed by Google DeepMind, the same team behind Gemini.

With Genie 3, you can simulate the real world and turn a text prompt into a new, playable, interactive world you can move through in real time.

As one user on Reddit [found](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1mic9r4/in_genie_3_you_can_look_down_and_see_you_walking/), you can even look down and see how you're walking in a world simulation created using Genie 3.

Genie 3 also generates a real human walking in the simulated world

Google says Genie 3 renders the world at 720p and 24 fps, and keeps the scene physically consistent for several minutes.

46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.
