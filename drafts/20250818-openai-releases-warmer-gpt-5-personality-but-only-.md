OpenAI has confirmed it has begun rolling out a new warmer personality for GPT-5, but remember that it won't be as warm as GPT-4o, which is still available for use under legacy models.

In a [post](https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1956461718097494196) on X, OpenAI confirmed users can try GPT-5 warmer personality on the web and mobile apps.

The company announced the feature on August 15, and it's now widely rolling out.

"You'll notice small, genuine touches like "Good question" or "Great start," not flattery. Internal tests show no rise in sycophancy compared to the previous GPT-5 personality," OpenaI noted.

Regardless, if you're not happy with GPT-5, you can follow these steps to restore GPT-4o as an option. As I warned above, these steps work only for Plus and Pro accounts:

1. Open chatgpt.com
2. Click on the profile name at the bottom left.
3. ClickÂ **Settings**

4. Turn on the toggle that says Show legacy models.

OpenAI has also restored o3 and other models, including 4o-mini.

46% of environments had passwords cracked, nearly doubling from 25% last year.
